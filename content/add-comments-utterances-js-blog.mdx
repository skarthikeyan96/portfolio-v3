## What is Utterances ? 

A Open source, lightweight comments widget built on GitHub issues. With help of utterances we can add commenting system to our blog. When a person comments via the widget it will be logged as issue to the repository in which the utterances has been configured. 

## Setting up Utterances 

Let's create a GitHub repository were we can install utterances. 

I have already created mine and named it as  [next-blog-utterances]( https://github.com/skarthikeyan96/next-blog-utterances )  


Next step is to install  [utterances]( https://utteranc.es/  )  app to our github account. 

Navigate to this [link](https://github.com/marketplace/utterances) and install the utterances app. Once done you will be asked to allow access to all the repositories or selected repositories. 

let's give access only to  the selected repositories.

## Adding Utterances to Next.js  blog.

Let's bootstrap our Next.js application. I am going to be using the  [starter blog](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter)  by Next.js. 

```jsx

 npx create-next-app --example blog-starter blog-starter-utterances

```

Once done run `yarn dev` and navigate to `localhost:3000` in our browser.

Now it's time to add our comments component to our post page. 

Navigate to `components` folder and create `comments.js` file and paste in the following code. 

```jsx


import React, { useRef } from "react";

import useScript from "../lib/use-script";

const Comments = () => {
  const comment = useRef(null);

  const status = useScript({
    url: "https://utteranc.es/client.js",
    theme: "github-dark",
    issueTerm: "url",
    repo: "skarthikeyan96/next-blog-utterances",
    ref: comment
  });

  return (
    <div className="w-full">
      {
        <div ref={comment}></div>
      }
    </div>
  );
};

export default Comments;

```
let's create custom `useScript` hook. Navigate to `lib` and create a file `use-script.js` and paste in the following code.

**Note: **

In this blog , I will be not be going in depth on the React hooks concept. For more understanding on the hooks concept , there is amazing series on  [hooks](https://lo-victoria.com/a-look-at-react-hooks-introduction)  written by @[Victoria Lo](@victoria).  

Back to coding

```jsx

import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

// we need a function that accepts the script src and couple of other parameters

const useScript = (params) => {
  const { url, theme, issueTerm, repo, ref } = params;

  const [status, setStatus] = useState(url ? "loading" : "idle");

  console.log(params);

  // run the useEffect when the url of the script changes
  useEffect(() => {
      if (!url) {
        setStatus("idle");
        return;
      }

      let script = document.createElement("script");
      script.src = url;
      script.async = true;
      script.crossOrigin = "anonymous";
      script.setAttribute("theme", theme);
      script.setAttribute("issue-term", issueTerm);
      script.setAttribute("repo", repo);

      // Add script to document body
      ref.current.appendChild(script);

      // store status of the script

      const setAttributeStatus = (event) => {
        /**
         * Console.log value from event
            {
                bubbles: false
                cancelBubble: false
                cancelable: false
                composed: false
                currentTarget: null
                defaultPrevented: false
                eventPhase: 0
                isTrusted: true
                path: [script]
                returnValue: true
                srcElement: null
                target: null
                timeStamp: 276483.5
                type: "load"
            }

            based on the type property we will get know whether script is ready or errored out
            */

        setStatus(event.type === "load" ? "ready" : "error");
        
      };

      script.addEventListener("load", setAttributeStatus);
      script.addEventListener("error", setAttributeStatus);

      return () => {
       // useEffect clean up
        if (script) {
          script.removeEventListener("load", setAttributeStatus);
          script.removeEventListener("error", setAttributeStatus);
        }
      };

  }, [url]);
  return status;
};

export default useScript;


```  

`useScript` hook takes in the source of the **script , github repo** which the user wants the comments to be created as issues, **theme , issue-term** and [ref](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html)  ( functionality in react which allows us to access the dom element ). 

Then we add create our script element,  plug in all the attributes and listen to script events `load` and `error`. Based on the type of the event , we set the status of the script and return it back to our component. 

The returned status of the script will be used by `comments` component which then creates the `iframe`  and renders the comments as expected.

Once done just reference the `comments` component in the `pages/posts/[slug].js` 

 Now head over to `localhost:3000` to see the magic

and when you head over to the configured github repository , you should be able to see the issues created.

üéâüéâüéâ Congratulations  you have successfully integrated utterances to your Next.js blog. The same process can be followed to add utterance to any web application with some tweaks.
