## How to deploy a react application present in a repository to Netlify ?

In this blog post , I will be sharing a problem I faced when trying to deploy a react app which is inside a repository to netlify. 

## Problem faced: 

So I have this repository `skarthikeyan96/local-hack-day-learn`  where I will be placing bunch of projects. 


I wanted to deploy my first app inside `local-hack-day-learn` which is a `todo list` [https://github.com/skarthikeyan96/local-hack-day-learn/tree/main/todo-list](https://github.com/skarthikeyan96/local-hack-day-learn/tree/main/todo-list)( ongoing ) to netlify.  



How do you do it ?

## Solution: 

Updating the **build** and **publish** folder in netlify either through their web application or via `netlify.toml` file. 

We will see both ways.

## Fix 1 : Updating the configuration from web application

Go to 
[Build Settings](https://app.netlify.com/sites/elegant-keller-4d2437/settings/deploys) section for the  application which you have already deployed or when you are deploying the application , you can update the `build` and `publish` sections under the build settings.

Since the `todo-list` application is bootstrapped  with `create-react-app` 

Set the base directory to `todo-list/`  and publish directory to `todo-list/build`  as recommended in the netlify docs[https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/%20](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/%20)

## Fix 2 : creating and updating netlify.toml file

The netlify. toml file is a configuration file that specifies how Netlify builds and deploys your site — including redirects, branch and context-specific settings, and more.

create your own `netlify.toml` in the root folder and update the following 

```toml

# Settings in the [build] context are global and are applied to all contexts
# unless otherwise overridden by more specific contexts.
[build]
  # Directory to change to before starting a build.
  # This is where we will look for package.json/.nvmrc/etc.
  # If not set, defaults to the root directory.
  base = "todo-list/"

  # Directory that contains the deploy-ready HTML files and assets generated by
  # the build. This is relative to the base directory if one has been set, or the
  # root directory if a base has not been set. This sample publishes the
  # directory located at the absolute path "root/project/build-output"
  publish = "todo-list/build"

 
```

That's it. These are the two ways, out of which I have used the first way to solve the problem.
