In this blog , we will be seeing how to add dark mode to your Next.js project using Tailwind.

let‚Äôs get started

## Stack

1. Next.js 
2. Tailwind css 
3. next-themes
4. Typescript

First things first , Let‚Äôs setup our Next.js Project. Head over to the terminal and type in the following command

```bash
npx create-next-app next-tailwind-boilerplate --ts
```

The above command will spin up a brand new Next.js project with eslint pre-configured. 

```bash
cd next-tailwind-boilerplate
yarn dev
```

After running the above command you should see the default Next.js site on your screen

## Adding Tailwind css :

Let‚Äôs add tailwind css to our project. We will be following the steps from the tailwind‚Äôs official [docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs).  Head over to the terminal and type in the following command

```bash
yarn add tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer -D
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

*Note: You can use npm as well to install your dependencies.*

The above command will install **tailwindcss,** it‚Äôs dependencies and  generates both¬†**`tailwind.config.js`** and¬†**`postcss.config.js`**. Head over to the config and paste the following. This will help tailwind css to know which files it needs to look for the classNames. 

More info on the docs about [content configuration](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration). 

```jsx
// tailwind.config.ts

module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Now we will be injecting tailwind css to our project. Head over to the `global.css` file and add in the following 

```css

/* global.css */

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Once done, add tailwind‚Äôs class to your `index.tsx` in pages directory.  Now kill your server and run it again using `yarn dev -p 3001`  in your terminal. Go to browser and hit [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) .

```javascript

...
<h1 className="text-3xl font-bold underline">
   Next.js + Tailwind Starter 
</h1>
...

```

## Adding dark mode using next-themes :

We will be using **[next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes)** to add dark mode toggle to our Next.js project. It has `ThemeProvider` which we can wrap our application and make use of the `useTheme` hook to get the current theme of the application. 

Head over to the terminal and type in the following command 

```bash
yarn add next-themes
```

Go to `_app.tsx` file and add in the following content and head over to the browser. 

```jsx
// _app.tsx

import { ThemeProvider } from 'next-themes'
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return(
    <ThemeProvider enableSystem={true} attribute="class">
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThemeProvider>
  ) 
}

```

You should see something like this. At first, It will take **theme** value from the system configuration. If you have dark mode enabled, when you set up your `ThemeProvider` then it will be **dark** else it will be in `light` mode. 

*Note: Try out the above thing which I mentioned by changing your system‚Äôs theme to `light` mode and go to the browser window to check the outcome. Let me know in the comments how it went.* 

Since we will be using tailwind‚Äôs class attribute to take care of the dark mode related styles `attribute` in the `ThemeProvider` will be `class` .

One more small change we need to make. Go to `tailwind.config.ts` and add `darkMode` attribute and set it to **class**. The reason is we will be using `className` attribute to change to add relevant dark mode styles to our application.

```jsx
module.exports = {
  darkMode: 'class',
  content: [
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Let‚Äôs add dark mode styles to our application. Head over to `pages/index.tsx` file and update the following. Head over to the browser and see the reflected change. 

```jsx

//index.tsx

...

<p className={styles.description}>
  Get started by editing{' '}
<code className='**dark:text-blue-400**'>pages/index.tsx</code>
</p>
...
```


Let‚Äôs build out the **toggle button**. Head over to the `pages/index.tsx` and update the following 

```jsx
import type { NextPage } from 'next'
import Head from 'next/head'
import styles from '../styles/Home.module.css'
import { useTheme } from 'next-themes';

const Home: NextPage = () => {

  const { systemTheme, theme, setTheme } = useTheme();

	// toggle responsible for changing the theme
  const renderThemeToggle = () => {
    const currentTheme = theme === "system" ? systemTheme : theme;
    if (currentTheme === "dark") {
      return (
        <button
        className='border rounded-sm p-2'
          onClick={() => setTheme("light")}
          type="button"
        > dark </button>
      );
    }
    return (
      <button
      className="border rounded-sm p-2"
      onClick={() => setTheme("dark")}
      type="button"
    > Light </button>
    );
  };

  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <Head>
        <title>Next.js and Tailwind starter</title>
        <meta name="description" content="Next.js and Tailwind starter" />
        <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
      </Head>

      <main className={styles.main}>
        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold underline mb-4">
          Next.js + Tailwind Starter 
        </h1>

        {renderThemeToggle()}

        <div className="m-3 pt-8">
          <h3 className='text-blue-400 dark:text-white'> Current theme is { theme }</h3>
         </div>
      </main>

     
    </div>
  )
}

export default Home
```

In the above code , we have made use of the `next-themes` hook to tell us what theme we are currently and use that to render the same thing on the browser. 

 

Head over to your browser to see the magic.
