## Creating a Blog with NextJS, Tailwindcss and  Netlify Headless CMS - Part 1

In this tutorial , we will be seeing how to create a dynamic blog using Next.js, Tailwindcss and  Netlify Headless CMS.

In part 1, we will be setting up our Next.js website from scratch and also getting know about the page routing system. 

Let's get started,

# What is Next.js 

Next JS is a javascript framework which allows you to built static and server side applications. It also provides out of the box features like automatic code-splitting, page-based routing system, static exporting options, and easy production builds. 


# Installing Next.js

You can finish this step by either two ways 

1. Installing the dependencies manually and setting up the project directory.
2. Using the `create-next-app` to create the app skeleton.

In this tutorial , I will be using step 1. You can also check out this [link](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) to learn more about `create-next-app`. 

Open a new terminal window (`Ctrl+Alt+T` on Linux or `Command+Space` on Mac) and execute the command below to create a new project folder (replace “your-project” with the name of your project):

```bash
mkdir your-project
```

Add `cd` into your new directory:

```bash
cd your-project
```

Next, run this command to create a `package.json` file in the root of your project:

```bash
npm init -y
```

The `npm init -y` command creates a `package.json` file in the root of your project directory.

The `-y` flag initialises the file with default values.

The `package.json` file will allow you to easily install and use npm package dependencies in your project.

Check out the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) if you want to learn more about the contents of the `package.json` file.

Now that we have a `package.json` file created, we can install the required npm package dependencies for your Next.js website.

To get started, we’ll need the [Next](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next), [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react), and [React-Dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom) npm packages.

You can install all of them at once with this command:

```bash
npm install --save next react react-dom
```

When those finish installing, you’ll notice that a new `node_modules` directory was created in your project.

Open `package.json` and add the following `scripts`:

```bash
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start"
}
```

These scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:

- `dev` - Runs `[next dev](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/cli#development)` which starts Next.js in development mode
- `build` - Runs `[next build](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/cli#build)` which builds the application for production usage
- `start` - Runs `[next start](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/cli#production)` which starts a Next.js production server

After this your directory structure should look like this 

Let's fire up the dev server and see what happens

```bash
npm run dev
```

You will be getting the following error

### **Pages:**

The page is basically how Next.js interprets the routes for the application. The `index.js` file will be responsible for the rendering of the homepage. 

For Example, if you want to route to the `/blogs` page, where you will have the list of the blogs rendered,  then the structure will be `pages/blog.js`. 

One more scenario will be visiting the particular blog which displays the complete blog details. This can be structured as `/pages/blog/[id].js`  . After this, any route like `/blog/1` or `/blog/abc` will be matched to the file. 

So you might have a question like, how can we access the id of the url?. It is possible. 

For example, the route `/blog/acd` will have the following query object

```jsx
{id : 'acd'}
```

  
This is called **Dynamic Routing.**

Check out the [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes) for more info on the routing.

Now we know about the `pages` features, let's go ahead and create them for our app and render the index file. 

```jsx
// pages/index.js

import React, { Component } from 'react'

export default class extends Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <div>Blog using Next JS</div>
    )
  }
}
```

Now run `npm run dev`, which will fire up the server. Open any browser and visit the URL `http://localhost:3000`. You should be able to see the output in the browser window. 

Congratulations, you have now created your first working Next.js website!
