# Auth0 Setup:

Create your Auth0 account if you have not created yet and head over to [manage.auth0.com](http://manage.auth0.com) link. Please create a tenant if you are using it for the first time.

Click on the `Applications` navigation link and click on `Create Application` .

Give your application `name` and click on single page web application as we will be integrating it with React.  I have named mine as `Dribble dashboard`.

Hit the `create` button. 

Before adding dribble connection to the sample application. We need two things from dribble 

`Client Id` and `Client Secret`. 

Let's go to dribble and register our application.


![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632591476269/MJxTMwbs4.png)

When you click on Register your application, you will be redirected to your Dribble profile page with Applications tab active. 


![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632591535679/dtZl3R0EW.png)


Give the name and description in the respective columns. Since we don't have the website url, let's give a placeholder [https://example.com](https://example.com) and for callback url your URL should be in this format. 

```markdown
https://YOUR_DOMAIN/login/callback
```

`YOUR_DOMAIN` can be found if you go to `Applications -> <name of the application>` , you will be find the domain name. 

In my case the `DOMAIN` will be [`react-pluralsight.auth0.com`](http://react-pluralsight.auth0.com/) and the url will be 

```markdown
https://react-pluralsight.auth0.com/login/callback
```

Construct your `YOUR_DOMAIN` likewise and add it in the `callback_url` and hit `Register application`.

Once done you will have access to `Client ID` and `Client Secret.`  Hold on to them , we will be needing in the further part of the tutorial. 

 

Now that we have sample application, let's add `dribble` connection. 

Go to `Authentication -> Social` and click on `Create Connection` and Choose `Dribble` , you will be redirected to following page.


![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632591617042/XVAhJ0LWH.png)

Click on `continue` and you will be redirected to the `configuration` page. Add the `client ID` and `client secret` which you got from the dribble application in the respective blocks and click `Create`.

Once done go to the applications tab and check your application.

Let's code. 

# Connecting React with Auth0

Let's create our react application using `create-react-app` . Run the below command.

```bash
npx create-react-app dribble-login

cd dribble-login

yarn start
```

Let's install `Auth0 sdk` , run the below command 

```bash
yarn add @auth0/auth0-react
```

Create a .env file in the root and add the following variables and values. You can get client id and domain from `applications -> settings`

![Screenshot 2021-09-25 at 10.39.04 PM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632589919553/SIG2FQQ8s.png)

```bash
REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID=
REACT_APP_DOMAIN=
```

Restart your application , for env variables to be recognised. 

Now go to `src/index.js` and add the following code

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
import { Auth0Provider } from "@auth0/auth0-react";

ReactDOM.render(
  <Auth0Provider
    domain={process.env.REACT_APP_DOMAIN}
    clientId={process.env.REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID}
    redirectUri={window.location.origin}
  >
    <App />
  </Auth0Provider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
); 
```

By wrapping `Auth0Provider`  from the `Auth0 SDK` to the root component and passing the domain and clientId we can integrate Auth0 with our react app. 

Let create a login button which will redirect Auth0 powered login splash screen. Create a `dribble-login.js` in `src` folder and paste the following code.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useAuth0 } from "@auth0/auth0-react";

/*
  Executing loginWithRedirect() redirects your users to the 
  Auth0 Universal Login Page, where Auth0 can authenticate them.
*/
const DribbleLogin = () => {
  const { loginWithRedirect, isAuthenticated } = useAuth0();

  if(!isAuthenticated){
    return <button onClick={() => loginWithRedirect()}>Log In</button>;
  }
  return <> </>

export default DribbleLogin;
```

Now head over to the `src/App.js` and add the `DribbleLogin` component.

```jsx
import DribbleLogin from './dribbleLogin';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <DribbleLogin/>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Now run `yarn start` and go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or `localhost:3001`

You should see something like this, plain old login button. Click `login` button.

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632590518037/o2yHVXJ0u.png)


You will end up in a page saying , `callback url mismatch`

What did we miss, 

![https://media.giphy.com/media/Y4iNEtsEseq6gEPp9e/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47ex9sjfmg57b7z0cx2otcxwzebjrc4j4q81xqvesu&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g](https://media.giphy.com/media/Y4iNEtsEseq6gEPp9e/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47ex9sjfmg57b7z0cx2otcxwzebjrc4j4q81xqvesu&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)

Based on the error message , we did not configure the callback, allowed web origin and logout url. 

What are those ?

**Callback URL**: URL in your application where Auth0 redirects the user after they have authenticated.

**Allowed Web origin:** Making sure the users does not logout the application when they visit them the next time or refresh the page 

**LogoutURL:** URL in your application that Auth0 can return to after the user has been logged out of the authorization server

Go to `settings` and add [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) url since the app is in the development stage.

Note: port number can be different. Please add them accordingly and save the changes.

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632591111011/RZTQo_LcP.png)

Since my react application is running on [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) , I will go to the url and run in the browser. Click the login button and now we should be able to see the splash screen as expected

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632591283911/hm6K1II4l.png)

After successful login with dribble , you will be redirected back to the react application with plain old login button. 


Let's handle it by making sure to add the logout button and profile info to display after successful login


# Rendering dribble profile

Create `src/logout.js` and logging out the user in the Auth0 can be done by calling logout function in the `useAuth0` hook. Add the following code 

```jsx

import React from "react";
import { useAuth0 } from "@auth0/auth0-react";

const Logout = () => {
  const { logout, isAuthenticated } = useAuth0();

  if(isAuthenticated){
    return (
        <button onClick={() => logout({ returnTo: window.location.origin })}>
          Log Out
        </button>
      );
  }
  return <> </>

};

export default Logout;

```

Create `src/profile.js` and add the following piece of code

```jsx

import React from "react";
import { useAuth0 } from "@auth0/auth0-react";

const Profile = () => {
  const { user, isAuthenticated, isLoading } = useAuth0();

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading ...</div>;
  }

  return (
    isAuthenticated && (
      <div style={{marginTop: '10px'}}>
        <img src={user.picture} alt={user.name} />
        <h2>{user.name}</h2>
        <p>{user.email}</p>
        <pre style={{whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap'}}> 
            {
            JSON.stringify(user)
        }
        </pre>
      </div>
    )
  );
};

export default Profile;

```

Here, again from `useAuth0` hook we display the profile info based `isAuthenticated` boolean we display the profile information.

Now let's add the component in the `App.js`  file  and modify as shown below

```jsx

import DribbleLogin from './dribbleLogin';
import Logout from './logout';
import Profile from './profile';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <DribbleLogin/>
      <Logout/>
      <Profile/>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;


```

Head over to the browser and hit reload, since we have already logged in we should successfully see the profile information displayed

# Conclusion: 

Thank you for following along till the end. By the end of the blog post , you should have sample react application connected to your dribble account , rendering the profile in the browser as expected. 

Auth0 has took care all of the behind the scenes authentication and authorisation problem and reducing the scope of the problem for the to solve.
